# Security: Proxy Trust Configuration
# Set to 'true' ONLY if application is behind a trusted reverse proxy (nginx, Cloudflare, AWS ALB).
# When true, the application will trust the 'x-forwarded-for' header for client IP extraction.
# When false or unset (default), the application will use direct connection IP only.
# WARNING: Setting this to 'true' without a trusted proxy allows IP spoofing attacks.
# Default: false (secure by default)
